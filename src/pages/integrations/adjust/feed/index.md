[Adjust](https://www.adjust.com) is a business intelligence platform for mobile app marketers, combining attribution for advertising sources with advanced analytics and store statistics.

## Attribution Data

The purpose of the Adjust feed is to collect attribution events from Adjust. The feed uses mParticle's [unified custom event type for attribution events](/developers/server/json-reference#custom-event) to capture an attribution postback from Adjust.

This event has an event type of `Custom Event`, a Custom Event Type of `attribution` and an Event Name of `attribution`. 

Each attribution event from Adjust will contain the following, where available:

### User and Device IDs

* Apple Advertising ID
* Apple Vendor ID
* Android Advertising ID
* Android ID
* Customer ID -- to send customer ID you must configure a `customer_id` callback parameter in Adjust. See [below](#adjust-configuration) for more
* MPID

### Custom Attributes

* `publisher` - this will be the `Network` in Adjust.
* `campaign` - this will be the Campaign Name in Adjust.
